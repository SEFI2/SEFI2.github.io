Hello, 
Here I want to share about my experience in competitive programming 
and about what I learnt while preparing for various online and offline competitions.

Competitive Programmers are the coders who compete with each other 
by solving algorithmic, logical and data structure problems in a given period of time.

There are various formats of "competitions" and there are a lot of 
different competitions. 

What are the main advantages of being a competitive programmer that I think:
1. Fast coding
2. Fast debugging
3. Strong knowledge of algorithms and data structures
4. Rewards for taking the top places


Here I list my favorite websites, where you can solve problems:
codeforces.com
codechef.com

And here is the resources to dig deep into this field:
