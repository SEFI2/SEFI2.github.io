Wow!! You are reading it!! I am nervous, it is my first post :).

From now on, I will try to write my thoughts about different types of software technologies that I am using and maybe little about my experience in this world of technology. 
I was thinking to start a blog since a long time ago, but , as always, I couldn't because "I didn't not have a time" or "Ops, I forgot". 
So, now to prevent myself being lazy, let me use a life hack, which will, as someone said, force me to do stuff that I want to do.
The trick is to tell and promise people, that I will post a blog at least once a week. So, I decided to use you as a person to tell and promise and you are now a witness of my following words:

> I will post a blog once a week. 

Let's see this method in work for a month and see if it works :D



Thank you that you read this post until the end.
